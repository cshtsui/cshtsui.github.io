<h2 id="principles">Principles and Approach</h2>


<p>At a high level, UI content should drive behavior and be clear, concise, and consistent. UI content shouldn&#39;t distract; in fact, content should be so simple, straightforward, and intuitive that it becomes almost invisible.</p>
<p>Before we dive in to the details, here are some general guidelines to remember:</p>
<p><strong>Keep your text short and simple</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use simple, direct sentences and labels that support the experience.</li>
<li>Cut out instructions and labels that aren&#39;t relevant to the task.</li>
<li>Aim for a 6th-8th grade reading level to reduce complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Write for your audience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consider your audience and adjust tone based on context.</li>
<li>Remove ambiguity by anticipating users&#39; needs and questions and providing just-in-time guidance.</li>
<li>Motivate users by focusing on positive outcomes and progress, not negative consequences.</li>
<li>Maintain a voice that is friendly and empathetic; conversational, but not casual; direct, but not impersonal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="be-concise">Be Concise</h3>
<p>It can be tempting to include all information that a user could ever potentially need to know about a task and to spell out every edge case. But the more information you add, the less clear the content becomes. Limit content to only what the user needs to know to complete the task at hand. Effective UI writing is as much about <strong>removing</strong> words as it is adding them.</p>
<p>Remember to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be specific.</li>
<li>Use short sentences.</li>
<li>Use contractions (e.g., &quot;don&#39;t&quot; instead of &quot;do not&quot;).</li>
<li>Make your verbs direct.<ul>
<li><strong>Do this:</strong> The team knows many different methodologies.</li>
<li><strong>Not this:</strong> The team has knowledge of many different methodologies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reread your text and look for ways to make it more concise.<ul>
<li><strong>Change this ...:</strong> The opinion of the participant …</li>
<li><strong>... to this:</strong> The participant&#39;s opinion …</li>
<li><strong>Change this ...:</strong> It is a matter of personal preference to each of us here at athenahealth as far as what our lunches at the café are made of.</li>
<li><strong>... to this:</strong> Each of us likes something different from the café.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid overly long phrases when shorter ones will do.<ul>
<li><strong>Do this:</strong> I am running a study <strong>on</strong> OB episodes.</li>
<li><strong>Not this:</strong> I am running a study <strong>concerning the matter of</strong> OB episodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for opportunities to save space (e.g., in a table where the column consists of dates, &quot;Modified&quot; can be used instead of &quot;Modified Date&quot; as the column heading).</li>
<li>Avoid wrapping to a new line for one (or two) words. Edit copy to fit allotted space.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="simple-language">Simple Language</h3>
<p>Our user base is wide, varied, and busy! Because of this, it’s important to write clearly and simply.</p>
<p>Writing simply isn&#39;t &quot;dumbing it down.&quot; Simple language is easy to understand and act on. Instead of taking up users&#39; attention, simple language gets its point across quickly and helps users get their work done faster.</p>
<p>Avoid jargon and aim for a 6th-8th grade reading level. Use <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Test-your-document-s-readability-85b4969e-e80a-4777-8dd3-f7fc3c8b3fd2#__toc342546555">Microsoft Word’s built-in readability tool</a> to confirm that your text hits the right level.</p>
<p><strong>Who benefits when we write in simple language?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People whose first language is not English</li>
<li>People with a condition that makes reading difficult, such as dyslexia</li>
<li>People who may have trouble concentrating because they are sick or undergoing treatment (e.g., flu, chemotherapy)</li>
<li>People who are stressed or distracted</li>
<li>Multitaskers and people whose jobs involve interruptions (e.g., doctors, nurses, receptionists)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="active-voice">Active Voice</h3>
<p>Use the active voice to give your sentences precision and strength. Avoid using the passive voice as much as possible.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-active-voice-and-passive-voice-">What are active voice and passive voice?</h4>
<p>In sentences written using the active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active:</strong> Mike submitted the proposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>In sentences written using the passive voice, the subject of the sentence receives the action:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Passive:</strong> The proposal was submitted by Mike.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sentence written in the active voice is shorter, clearer, and more direct.</p>
<p>Not sure how to detect passive voice? Fight it with zombies! If you can insert &quot;by zombies&quot; after the verb in your sentence and the sentence still makes sense, it&#39;s passive.</p>
<ul>
<li>The page was reviewed [by zombies].</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="exceptions-when-is-passive-voice-ok-">Exceptions: When is passive voice OK?</h4>
<p>The passive voice may be useful when you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Emphasize the action, not the person taking it</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: The appointment was successfully scheduled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Keep the subject consistent throughout a passage</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: I presented my proposal to Jen. After some discussion, the proposal was accepted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Be tactful by not naming the subject</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: The results are skewed because this survey question was misunderstood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Describe something, but the subject is unknown or unimportant</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Each year, thousands of patient records are created in athenaNet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Declare a rule</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Appointments cannot be scheduled more than two weeks in advance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="presentation-and-hierarchy">Presentation and Hierarchy</h3>
<h4 id="page-or-section-title">Page or Section Title</h4>
<p>Each athenaNet page should have a title near the top that someone could use to describe where they are (e.g., &quot;I&#39;m on the &#39;Review Medications&#39; page.&quot;). If a page is just a container for several sections, those sections can have their own titles instead (e.g., &quot;I&#39;m looking at the &#39;My Messages&#39; section, on the right.&quot;).</p>
<p>This title should be descriptive and unique throughout athenaNet. These titles orient users and give O-help writers, documentation writers, and trainers a way to refer to pages distinctly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do this:</strong> Edit Claim Details</li>
<li><strong>Not this:</strong> Edit Details</li>
</ul>
<p>Design/implementation note: Layout, size, and styling are at the designer&#39;s discretion. A page/section title doesn’t necessarily need to be a huge header. It just needs to be visible text that someone can use to refer to the page.</p>
<h4 id="introductory-text">Introductory Text</h4>
<p>Intro text can be used to set context and provide general instruction, but it doesn&#39;t need to describe what is obvious from looking at the page (e.g., &quot;Complete all required fields and click <strong>Continue</strong>&quot;).</p>
<div class="fg_image-container">
  <img src="../../assets/images/content-style-guide/intro_text.jpg" alt="Screenshot of &quot;Payment Mismatch Tracking&quot; form. It has a header, some introductory text, and form fields with labels.">
</div>

<p>Users tend to ignore copy that is visually disconnected from the task. Instead of listing all relevant details in the introductory text above the task, provide guidance (as necessary) at the form, section, and/or control level.</p>
<h4 id="in-context-help">In-context Help</h4>
<p>Providing additional help content via info icons and &quot;Learn more&quot; links can be useful if a process/section/field is likely to raise questions with most users.</p>
<ul>
<li>Info icons can be used to define terminology that might not be familiar to all users.<ul>
<li>Example: Form CP-575 is a letter you received from the IRS granting your employer identification number.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Learn more&quot; links can be used to provide insight into a new process. For example, if you’re asking users to do something they may not want to do and you need to explain why the task is necessary:<ul>
<li>This tool allows you to track the number of patient emails your department collects each day. Collecting patient emails is a crucial first step in satisfying the Meaningful Use Secure Messaging measure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, use in-context help content sparingly. The majority of your labels and on-page guidance should be able to stand alone without further clarification.</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>When information is necessary to complete a task (e.g., indicating a maximum file size), use an on-page note.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes should be placed below the field/control/item being clarified.</li>
<li>Consider using &quot;<strong>Important:</strong>&quot; as the note label if the information is particularly critical.</li>
</ul>
<div class="fg_image-container">
  <img src="../../assets/images/content-style-guide/hint_text.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of a form field labeled &quot;Profile photo&quot;. Below the form field is advisory text about what file types are accepted.">

<h2 id="voicetone">Voice and Tone</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Voice</strong> refers to the unique, distinctive personality of our brand. Just as every person has a voice that doesn’t change, our voice stays the same for each audience. Maintaining a consistent voice builds trust with our users.</p>
<p><strong>Tone</strong> is how we use our voice in different situations. We adjust our tone based on context and audience. This is the same way that people adjust their tone when chatting with a close friend versus writing a business email.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, voice is what makes us unique and tone is what makes us sound human.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>At athenahealth, our client-facing voice is friendly and empathetic; conversational when appropriate, but not casual; direct, but not impersonal.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conversational sounds like:</strong> Want to share information without waiting for a follow-up appointment? Use your Patient Portal to keep in touch.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Not like:</strong> If you have notified us that you intend to terminate the relationship (gulp!), the final data set is complimentary (just to prove we don&#39;t have any hard feelings).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Empathetic sounds like:</strong> These tools allow anesthesiologists to focus on patient care without having to spend countless hours worrying about documenting in a compliant manner. Risk management affects your organization—athenahealth is here to help you manage these risk scores.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Not like:</strong> As a busy provider, we feel your pain. By now you should have gotten the point that co-sourcing requires we have a good relationship with each other. :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, refer to our <a href="http://share.athenahealth.com/tweety/UX/Copy/Copy%20Resources/client%20voice%20+%20tone%20guide_final%20draft.pdf">Client Communications Voice and Tone Guidelines</a>.</p>
<h2 id="consumers">Writing for Consumers</h2>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>When we write copy for athenahealth’s business (client-facing) products, we anticipate that the users reading it are health professional staff working in an office or clinical setting.</p>
<p>Writing copy for our consumer products is a different situation. These users are patients and possibly their family and carers. We need to consider additional factors that can affect reading and understanding text, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Illness:</strong> Users may be coping with physical or mental illness (e.g., having the flu and booking an appointment to get it treated).</li>
<li><strong>Stress and emotions:</strong> Examples of stressful or emotional situations include waiting for test results, caring for sick loved ones, and handling medical bills.</li>
<li><strong>Setting:</strong> Consumers may be using these products in a variety of places (at home, on a library computer, on a mobile phone while holding a baby) and times (late at night, on a hurried lunch break, during a commute, on the way to the hospital).</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, when writing copy for consumer products, it is extremely important to write clearly and simply. We must also consider the users&#39; situation and what information matters most at that time.</p>
<h3 id="writing-tips">Writing Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use short sentences and simple words.<ul>
<li>It’s better to use two short words that the user understands instead of one long word they do not.</li>
<li>Try counting the syllables of your words. The ones with more syllables are good candidates for simplifying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write numbers as digits (1,2,3), not words (one, two, three).<ul>
<li>Do this even when the number begins the sentence. If it looks awkward, see if the sentence can be revised to begin with a different word.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Include accurate medical terms, but define or explain them when you use them for the first time.  <ul>
<li>Example: &quot;You will need to give a urine sample for a test to make sure your kidneys are healthy (microalbumin test).&quot;</li>
<li>Even if a term seems long or complex, it&#39;s important to show the exact wording (along with an explanation). Users may need it for insurance questions or for internet searching.</li>
<li>Use exact terms when requesting that a user perform a specific action. If you want a user to get a Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, you need to make sure you use that term and then define it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aim for a readability score of 8.0 (eighth grade) or lower.<ul>
<li>An ideal score is around 5.0 (fifth grade).</li>
<li>Exclude medical terms when running the test.</li>

<h3 id="voice-and-tone">Voice and Tone</h3>
<p>When we create consumer-facing copy, we are either speaking as our clients&#39; partner or speaking directly to our clients’ patients/consumers in the voice of that client. Content should always reinforce the client-patient relationship and enhance our clients&#39; brands.</p>
<p><strong>Do this:</strong>
&quot;Thank you for choosing us as your healthcare provider. You have a new billing statement available through the patient portal. Please review your bill and make a payment today.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Not this:</strong>
&quot;Your bill is overdue. If you do not pay it in full today, we will send you to collections. Pay your bill now.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="word-list">Word List</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immunization/vaccination/shot</strong><ul>
<li>When using the proper term, use immunization or vaccination.</li>
<li>Otherwise, use the more casual &quot;shot&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Appointment/visit/check up</strong><ul>
<li>&quot;Visit&quot; is more appropriate for primary and routine care (e.g., sick visit, wellness visit).</li>
<li>&quot;Appointment&quot; is more appropriate for specific services (e.g., mammogram appointment).</li>
<li>&quot;Check up&quot; is a vague term and should only be used when we need to be intentionally vague.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Book&quot; vs. &quot;schedule&quot; vs. &quot;make&quot; an appointment</strong><ul>
<li>&quot;Make an appointment&quot;<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="style">Style - General</h2>

<h3 id="acronyms-and-initialisms">Acronyms and initialisms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Generally spelled out for first appearance in body copy, followed by the acronym/initialism in parentheses. No periods.</li>
<li>Example: &quot;One product is an electronic health record (EHR).&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="buttons">Buttons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Button names:<ul>
<li>Title case capitalization. For example, &quot;Submit Form&quot;, &quot;Download Report.&quot;</li>
<li>Concise. If button copy is long, then it may be trying to explain too much about its function. Consider clarifying this somewhere else on the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Writing instructions about buttons:<ul>
<li>When referring to buttons, bold the button name (&quot;Enter your password and click <strong>Log In</strong>.&quot;)</li>
<li>Users &quot;click&quot; a button, not &quot;click on,&quot; &quot;press,&quot; or &quot;hit.&quot;<ul>
<li><strong>Exception:</strong> In touch screen interfaces, &quot;tap&quot; is appropriate instead of &quot;click.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unless confusion is likely, omit the word &quot;button.&quot;  (&quot;Click <strong>Log In</strong>&quot;, not &quot;Click the <strong>Log In</strong> button.&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="branding-and-product-names">Branding and product names</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use athenahealth (company) and athenaNet (app), not &quot;athena.&quot;</li>
<li>Use athenaCommunicator, not &quot;Communicator&quot; (and similar for other product names).</li>
<li>&quot;Patient Portal&quot; (uppercase) vs. &quot;the portal&quot; (lowercase).</li>
<li>Lowercase company name/products are always lowercase, even when they begin a sentence.</li>
<li>Refer to marketing materials for proper branding/product names: <a href="https://athenabrand.guide/">athenaHealth branding guidelines</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="clients-users-and-customers">Clients, users, and customers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use &quot;clients&quot; (not &quot;customers&quot;) to refer to users in aggregate (e.g., &quot;athenaClinicals clients have access to this feature.&quot;).</li>
<li>Use &quot;users&quot; to describe activity (e.g., &quot;Another user is editing this file.&quot;).</li>
<li>Maintain a conversational voice by addressing the user when possible. Use &quot;you&quot; (clients) and &quot;we&quot; (athenahealth).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="continue-vs-next">Continue vs. next</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>continue</strong> when navigating through sequential steps in a workflow (e.g., moving through multiple steps for setting up an account).</li>
<li>Use <strong>next</strong> when navigating through non-sequential screens or items (e.g., moving from one document or claim to another).  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="drop-down-lists">Drop-down lists</h3>
<ul>
<li>Default selection for a drop-down list is &quot;- Select -&quot;</li>
<li>In help text, avoid using the term &quot;drop-down&quot;. Use &quot;menu&quot; or &quot;list&quot; instead.</li>
<li>Example: Choose a doctor from the list below (not &quot;the drop-down list below&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="errors-and-alerts">Errors and alerts</h3>
<h4 id="errors">Errors</h4>
<p>Error messages can result from an unexpected system failure or an action taken by the user.
Form validation errors generally result from the user entering information that&#39;s incomplete or inaccurate or that doesn’t match an expected format. Inline messaging is recommended for form validation errors. That way, attention is properly focused on the form fields that need editing (rather than somewhere else on the page).</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: This discount code has expired.</li>
</ul>
<p>Placement and styling of error messages can vary by product and context.</p>
<p>If inline error messages may be missed by the user (e.g., the form fields are below the fold), additional messaging can be used at the top of the page to indicate that one or more fields require attention.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example (top of page): You must complete all required fields.</li>
<li>Example (inline): You have not entered a last name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Error messages should give users the information needed to fix mistakes. Be clear and specific about why the user&#39;s input was not accepted.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do this:</strong> Email address should match the format &quot;<a href="mailto:person@domain.com">person@domain.com</a>&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Not this:</strong> Invalid email address</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="alerts">Alerts</h4>
<p>Alerts are conditional messages that are displayed temporarily. They call attention to a change or encourage/require the user to take an action. Alerts should not be used to emphasize or stylize static page text.  </p>
<p>There are four categories of alerts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 - Information (purple/blue)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Displays information that may be helpful or important to users but that doesn’t require action.</li>
<li>Example: This patient&#39;s dosage for amoxicillin was adjusted on 11-20-16.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>2 - Confirmation/success (green)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Informs users that their action was completed successfully. Confirmation messages may not be necessary if the successful completion of the task is apparent (e.g., if users can see that an item was added or updated).</li>
<li>Example: Provider information was successfully updated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>3 - Attention (orange or yellow - varies by UI color palette)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Warns users that a problem has happened or that action is required.</li>
<li>Example: Your practice must improve its performance on the Security Risk Assessment measure to stay on track for Meaningful Use. Take action</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>4 - Critical (red)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reserved for patient safety and other highly important issues (such as business issues that affect the financial health of the client).</li>
<li>Example: Conflict with patient allergy: ASPIRIN</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For color details, see the <a href="../foundations/color.html#alert">Forge guide documentation on alert colors</a>.</p>
<h3 id="field-labels">Field labels</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sentence case capitalization (e.g., &quot;Last name&quot;, &quot;Date of service&quot;).</li>
<li>Nouns, not instruction (e.g., &quot;First name&quot;, not &quot;Enter first name&quot;).</li>
<li>No colon (:)<ul>
<li><strong>Exception:</strong> For read-only displays, colons may be used in certain circumstances depending on the design.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not use an input’s placeholder text instead of a label. This affects accessibility.<ul>
<li>Labels provide context. When users click into an input field, placeholder text disappears. This is not helpful for users with reading or memory issues who may need a persistent reminder of what the input field is for.</li>
<li>Screen readers use labels to provide context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="filtering-searching">Filtering, searching</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>filter</strong> is used to narrow information displayed on a page.<ul>
<li>Title is &quot;Filter by&quot;</li>
<li>Button is &quot;Filter&quot;</li>
<li>Link is &quot;Reset&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>lookup</strong> is used to search for information that is not displayed on a page by entering specific criteria.<ul>
<li>Title is &quot;[Item] Lookup&quot;</li>
<li>Button is &quot;Find&quot;</li>
<li>Link is &quot;Reset&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="less-vs-fewer">Less vs. fewer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>less</strong> when describing something that is a single mass or concept (less water, less time, less stress).</li>
<li>Use <strong>fewer</strong> when describing things that can be individually counted (fewer patients, fewer columns, fewer buttons).  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="links">Links</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sentence case capitalization.<ul>
<li><strong>Exceptions:</strong><ul>
<li>In Streamlined patterns, standalone links are all-caps. Links that are part of, or follow, a sentence are sentence case.</li>
<li>In Classic tables, action links are lowercase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid &quot;click here&quot; as link copy. Using the subject (or verb-subject) is more concise and properly focuses attention.<ul>
<li><strong>Do this:</strong> View the patient&#39;s demographic information.</li>
<li><strong>Not this:</strong> Click here to view the patient&#39;s demographic information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bulleted (unordered) or numbered (ordered) lists:<ul>
<li>Use a numbered list if the order of the items is significant (e.g., step-by-step instructions).</li>
<li>Otherwise, use a bulleted list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introduce bulleted lists with a colon (e.g., &quot;Important things to know:&quot;).</li>
<li>Be concise. One feature/benefit/thought per bullet.</li>
<li>Use punctuation consistently.<ul>
<li>If the list items are complete sentences, use a period after each item.</li>
<li>If the list items are phrases (e.g., Faster response time, Less work), do not use periods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the same structure for list items (i.e., make them parallel). They should start with the same part of speech and use the same tense.<ul>
<li><strong>Do this:</strong> Activities of daily living include:<ul>
<li>Washing clothes</li>
<li>Walking</li>
<li>Driving a car</li>
<li>Talking on the phone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Not this:</strong> Activities of daily living include:<ul>
<li>Washing clothes</li>
<li>Walks</li>
<li>To drive a car</li>
<li>People talking on the phone</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="plural-vs-singular">Plural vs. singular</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using &quot;(s)&quot; to indicate that something can have either one response or multiple. Use a plural label if there&#39;s a chance of multiple answers.</li>
<li>Column headings should be singular if each cell in the column contains one piece of information, and plural if each cell could contain multiple pieces of information.<ul>
<li>Example: Use &quot;Denial Reason&quot; as the column heading if there’s only one reason per row; use &quot;Denial Reasons&quot; if there could be more than one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="view-vs-show">View vs. show</h3>
<p>Use <strong>view</strong> when the user&#39;s context will change (e.g., a modal or new page will open).</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: View test results, View history</li>
</ul>
<p>Use <strong>show</strong> when the user’s display on the current page will change (e.g., the user will see more instances of a listed item, additional details related to an item will be displayed, or a UI element will be added).</p>
<p>If &quot;show&quot; is appropriate, consider the context:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When more detail will be revealed about an item, use a show/hide toggle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Show notes, Hide notes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When more instances of a listed item will be shown, use a &quot;more&quot; toggle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Show more, Show fewer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>When users need to know quantity, display the number that will be added.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Show more (10), Show fewer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When all instances of a listed item will be shown, use an &quot;all&quot; toggle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Show all, Show fewer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>When users need to know quantity, display the total number of items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Show all (100), Show fewer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When it&#39;s not clear what is being shown, add detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Show more results, Show fewer results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When truncated text is displayed, use &quot;…Show more/Show less.&quot;  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capitalization">Capitalization</h2>

<p>athenaNet and the Patient Portal use a combination of sentence case and title case, depending on context.</p>
<h3 id="formats">Formats</h3>
<h4 id="sentence-case">Sentence case</h4>
<ul>
<li>Capitalize the first word and proper nouns.</li>
<li>Examples: &quot;First and last name&quot;, &quot;Other locations around Massachusetts&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="title-case">Title case</h4>
<ul>
<li>Capitalize the first and last words and all other words except:<ul>
<li>Prepositions (e.g., around, near, of, on, with, without, about)</li>
<li>Articles (e.g., a, an, the)</li>
<li>Conjunctions (e.g., and, but)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Examples: &quot;Delete Patient Record&quot;, &quot;Date of Service&quot;</li>
<li>Need help? Try this <a href="http://titlecase.com/">title case converter</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="all-caps">All caps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Avoid all caps, as it reduces readability and can be interpreted as shouting.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hyphenated-words">Hyphenated words</h4>
<ul>
<li>When hyphenated words are part of a title, capitalize both words unless they are articles, prepositions, or coordinating conjunctions (and, but, for, or, nor).</li>
<li>Example: In-Depth</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some products use a conversational, less formal tone in their copy (for example, products where patients are the intended audience). Even though an element may normally require title case, consider using sentence case instead if title case would make copy look awkward.<ul>
<li><strong>Do this:</strong> (button text) Yes, this is my doctor</li>
<li><strong>Not this:</strong> Yes, This is My Doctor</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2 id="punctuation">Punctuation</h2>

<h3 id="ampersand-">Ampersand (&amp;)</h3>
<ul>
<li>When space is limited, an ampersand (&amp;) can be used instead of the word &quot;and&quot; if the two terms are conceptually connected.</li>
<li>Example: Assessment &amp; Plan</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="commas">Commas</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the serial comma (also called the Oxford comma). This means adding a comma <strong>before</strong> the final &quot;and&quot; in a list.<ul>
<li>Example: Our employees are doctors, nurses, and medical assistants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a comma between name and degree (Jane Doe, MD).</li>
<li>No comma between month and year (January 2010).</li>
<li>Use a comma after dates when referring to month, date, and year (January 4, 2010).</li>
<li>Use a comma after &quot;e.g.&quot; and &quot;i.e.&quot;<ul>
<li>Example: Use this form to order office supplies (e.g., paper, pens, staplers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ellipsis-">Ellipsis (…)</h3>
<ul>
<li>An ellipsis (plural, ellipses) is three periods in a row. It can be rendered as a single HTML character (<code>&amp;#8230;</code> or <code>&amp;hellip;</code>), which prevents the periods from being separated by line breaks.</li>
<li>In UI copy, an ellipsis can mean incompleteness, hidden/overflow content, or more of something inside. Uses include:<ul>
<li>Showing that text has been truncated (for example, displaying &quot;hyperli…&quot; instead of &quot;hyperlipidemia&quot; if the full text is too long for the allotted space)</li>
<li>Conveying that a process is still running (such as in placeholder text like &quot;Getting patient records …&quot; or &quot;Loading claims data …&quot;)</li>

<h3 id="bolding-italics-and-emphasis">Bolding, italics, and emphasis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bold text for emphasis should be used sparingly. Bolding the right word or phrase can help to focus attention; bolding an entire sentence reduces readability and is less effective as emphasis. Avoid bolding entire paragraphs.</li>
<li>Bold text is used to refer to UI elements (such as buttons and links) when providing specific instructions. It is not used when writing about a term or UI element more conceptually.<ul>
<li>Writing specific instructions: &quot;Enter your password and click <strong>Log In</strong>.&quot;</li>
<li>Writing more conceptually: &quot;Verify all information is correct in the Patient Demographic section.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bold text should be the same color as the accompanying non-bold text.  Using a different color can be misinterpreted as a link.</li>
<li>Avoid using italics for emphasis when possible; they can reduce readability. Bolding is preferred.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="date-and-time">Date and time</h3>
<ul>
<li>Date format: MM-DD-YYYY (or MM-DD-YY depending on space constraints and context)</li>
<li>When weekday abbreviations are necessary, use: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun (no period at the end)</li>
<li>Time format: 10:30 AM EST</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="medications">Medications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some athenahealth products use specific formats for medication names for safety and clarity reasons. Check with your PO whether these apply to your work. Formats include:<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ismp.org/recommendations/tall-man-letters-list">Tall Man lettering</a> for visually distinguishing medications with similar names<ul>
<li>Example: acetaZOLAMIDE and acetoHEXAMIDE</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="numbers">Numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li>In body copy, use numerals for 10 and above, spell out zero through nine unless the number precedes a unit of measure (3 quarts, three cars).</li>
<li>Use this system with flexibility:<ul>
<li>Avoid statements such as &quot;Nine of the 12 patients arrived for their appointments.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a number in the UI is variable, always use a numeral.<ul>
<li>Example: 5 items selected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Include a space between numbers and units (e.g., 300 KB).</li>
<li>Safety issues: Some athenahealth products use special number formats as a safety precaution. Check with your PO whether this applies to your work. For example, these styles may be used for medication doses:<ul>
<li>Including leading zeroes: &quot;0.5&quot; rather than &quot;.5&quot;</li>
<li>Leaving out trailing zeroes: &quot;10&quot; rather than &quot;10.0&quot;</li>
</ul>

This guide allows us to keep track of our precedents to ensure we're creating a seamless experience for our users. It also prevents us from having to make the same decisions over and over again.\n\n### Resources\nIn addition to this style guide, we use the [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) for broader stylistic choices and the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) for software and UI conventions.\n\nOur writing uses American spelling. Refer to [Merriam-Webster's online dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) to check spelling.\n\n### Questions? Suggestions?\nNeed writing help?

UI content shouldn't distract; in fact, content should be so simple, straightforward, and intuitive that it becomes almost invisible.\n\nBefore we dive in to the details, here are some general guidelines to remember:\n\n__Keep your text short and simple__\n* Use simple, direct sentences and labels that support the experience.\n* Cut out instructions and labels that aren't relevant to the task.\n* Aim for a 6th-8th grade reading level to reduce complexity.\n\n__Write for your audience__\n* Consider your audience and adjust tone based on context.\n* Remove ambiguity by anticipating users' needs and questions and providing just-in-time guidance.\n* Motivate users by focusing on positive outcomes and progress, not negative consequences.\n* Maintain a voice that is friendly and empathetic; conversational, but not casual; direct, but not impersonal.\n\n### Be Concise\nIt can be tempting to include all information that a user could ever potentially need to know about a task and to spell out every edge case. But the more information you add, the less clear the content becomes. Limit content to only what the user needs to know to complete the task at hand. Effective UI writing is as much about __removing__ words as it is adding them.\n\nRemember to:\n* Be specific.\n* Use short sentences.\n* Use contractions (e.g., \"don't\" instead of \"do not\").\n* Make your verbs direct.\n  * __Do this:__ The team knows many different methodologies.\n  * __Not this:__ The team has knowledge of many different methodologies.\n* Reread your text and look for ways to make it more concise.\n  * __Change this ...:__ The opinion of the participant …\n  *  __... to this:__ The participant's opinion …\n  * __Change this ...:__ It is a matter of personal preference to each of us here at athenahealth as far as what our lunches at the café are made of.\n  * __... to this:__ Each of us likes something different from the café.\n* Avoid overly long phrases when shorter ones will do.\n  * __Do this:__ I am running a study __on__ OB episodes.\n  * __Not this:__ I am running a study __concerning the matter of__ OB episodes.\n* Look for opportunities to save space (e.g., in a table where the column consists of dates, \"Modified\" can be used instead of \"Modified Date\" as the column heading).\n* Avoid wrapping to a new line for one (or two) words. Edit copy to fit allotted space.\n\n### Simple Language\nOur user base is wide, varied, and busy! Because of this, it’s important to write clearly and simply.\n\nWriting simply isn't \"dumbing it down.\" Simple language is easy to understand and act on. Instead of taking up users' attention, simple language gets its point across quickly and helps users get their work done faster.\n\nAvoid jargon and aim for a 6th-8th grade reading level. Use [Microsoft Word’s built-in readability tool](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Test-your-document-s-readability-85b4969e-e80a-4777-8dd3-f7fc3c8b3fd2#__toc342546555) to confirm that your text hits the right level.\n\n__Who benefits when we write in simple language?__\n* People whose first language is not English\n* People with a condition that makes reading difficult, such as dyslexia\n* People who may have trouble concentrating because they are sick or undergoing treatment (e.g., flu, chemotherapy)\n* People who are stressed or distracted\n* Multitaskers and people whose jobs involve interruptions (e.g., doctors, nurses, receptionists)\n\nHere are some word changes to help simplify your writing:\n\n<table class=\"fg_content-table\">\n<thead>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Instead of these:</th>\n\t\t<th>Try these:</th>\n\t</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>\nThe reason for …  \nDue to / in light of the fact that …  \nThis is why …  \n</td>\n\t\t<td>Because, why</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Despite / regardless of the fact that…</td>\n\t\t<td>Although, even, though</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>In the event that…</td>\n\t\t<td>If</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>\nIt is crucial / necessary / important that ...  \nThere is a need / necessity for …  \n</td>\n\t\t<td>Must, should</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>\n… is able to …  \n… has the opportunity to / capacity for …  \n</td>\n\t\t<td>Can</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>\nIt is possible that …  \nThere is a chance that …  \nThe possibility exists for …  \n</td>\n\t\t<td>May, might, can, could</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Cognizant of</td>\n\t\t<td>Know</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Facilitate</td>\n\t\t<td>Help</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Implement</td>\n\t\t<td>Start</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Subsequent to</td>\n\t\t<td>After</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Utilize</td>\n\t\t<td>Use</td>\n\t</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n#### Resources for Learning More\nFor more suggestions and examples, check out these plain language writing resources:\n\n* Tutorials:\n  * [National Institutes of Health online course](https://plainlanguage.nih.gov/CBTs/PlainLanguage/login.asp)\n  * [Federal Aviation Administration online course](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/plain_language/basic_course/)\n* Organizations:\n  * [Center for Plain Language](https://centerforplainlanguage.org/)\n  * [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/)\n* [\"Before and after\" examples of simplified text](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/examples/)\n\n### Active Voice\nUse the active voice to give your sentences precision and strength. Avoid using the passive voice as much as possible.\n\n#### What are active voice and passive voice?\nIn sentences written using the active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action:\n* __Active:__ Mike submitted the proposal.\n\nIn sentences written using the passive voice, the subject of the sentence receives the action:\n* __Passive:__ The proposal was submitted by Mike.\n\nThe sentence written in the active voice is shorter, clearer, and more direct.\n\nNot sure how to detect passive voice? Fight it with zombies! If you can insert \"by zombies\" after the verb in your sentence and the sentence still makes sense, it's passive.\n* The page was reviewed [by zombies].\n\n#### Exceptions: When is passive voice OK?\nThe passive voice may be useful when you want to:\n\n* Emphasize the action, not the person taking it\n\t* Example: The appointment was successfully scheduled.\n\n* Keep the subject consistent throughout a passage\n\t* Example: I presented my proposal to Jen. After some discussion, the proposal was accepted.\n\n* Be tactful by not naming the subject\n\t* Example: The results are skewed because this survey question was misunderstood.\n\n* Describe something, but the subject is unknown or unimportant\n\t* Example: Each year, thousands of patient records are created in athenaNet.\n\n* Declare a rule\n\t* Example: Appointments cannot be scheduled more than two weeks in advance.\n\n### Presentation and Hierarchy\n\n#### Page or Section Title\nEach athenaNet page should have a title near the top that someone could use to describe where they are (e.g., \"I'm on the 'Review Medications' page.\"). If a page is just a container for several sections, those sections can have their own titles instead (e.g., \"I'm looking at the 'My Messages' section, on the right.\").\n\nThis title should be descriptive and unique throughout athenaNet. These titles orient users and give O-help writers, documentation writers, and trainers a way to refer to pages distinctly.\n* __Do this:__ Edit Claim Details\n* __Not this:__ Edit Details\n\nDesign/implementation note: Layout, size, and styling are at the designer's discretion. A page/section title doesn’t necessarily need to be a huge header. It just needs to be visible text that someone can use to refer to the page.\n\n#### Introductory Text\nIntro text can be used to set context and provide general instruction, but it doesn't need to describe what is obvious from looking at the page (e.g., \"Complete all required fields and click __Continue__\").\n\n<div class=\"fg_image-container\">\n  ![Screenshot of \"Payment Mismatch Tracking\" form. It has a header, some introductory text, and form fields with labels.]({{ path '/assets/images/content-style-guide/intro_text.jpg' }})\n</div>\n\nUsers tend to ignore copy that is visually disconnected from the task. Instead of listing all relevant details in the introductory text above the task, provide guidance (as necessary) at the form, section, and/or control level.\n\n#### In-context Help\nProviding additional help content via info icons and \"Learn more\" links can be useful if a process/section/field is likely to raise questions with most users.\n\n* Info icons can be used to define terminology that might not be familiar to all users.\n  * Example: Form CP-575 is a letter you received from the IRS granting your employer identification number.\n* \"Learn more\" links can be used to provide insight into a new process. For example, if you’re asking users to do something they may not want to do and you need to explain why the task is necessary:\n  * This tool allows you to track the number of patient emails your department collects each day. Collecting patient emails is a crucial first step in satisfying the Meaningful Use Secure Messaging measure.\n\nThat said, use in-context help content sparingly. The majority of your labels and on-page guidance should be able to stand alone without further clarification.\n\n#### Notes\nWhen information is necessary to complete a task (e.g., indicating a maximum file size), use an on-page note.\n* Notes should be placed below the field/control/item being clarified.\n* Consider using \"__Important:__\" as the note label if the information is particularly critical.\n\n<div class=\"fg_image-container\">\n  ![Screenshot of a form field labeled \"Profile photo\". Below the form field is advisory text about what file types are accepted.]({{ path '/assets/images/content-style-guide/hint_text.jpeg' }})\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"voicetone\">Voice and Tone</h2>\n\n### Overview\n__Voice__ refers to the unique, distinctive personality of our brand. Just as every person has a voice that doesn’t change, our voice stays the same for each audience. Maintaining a consistent voice builds trust with our users.\n\n__Tone__ is how we use our voice in different situations. We adjust our tone based on context and audience. This is the same way that people adjust their tone when chatting with a close friend versus writing a business email.\n\nIn a nutshell, voice is what makes us unique and tone is what makes us sound human.\n\n### Usage\nAt athenahealth, our client-facing voice is friendly and empathetic; conversational when appropriate, but not casual; direct, but not impersonal.\n\n* __Conversational sounds like:__ Want to share information without waiting for a follow-up appointment? Use your Patient Portal to keep in touch.\n\n* __Not like:__ If you have notified us that you intend to terminate the relationship (gulp!), the final data set is complimentary (just to prove we don't have any hard feelings).\n\n* __Empathetic sounds like:__ These tools allow anesthesiologists to focus on patient care without having to spend countless hours worrying about documenting in a compliant manner. Risk management affects your organization—athenahealth is here to help you manage these risk scores.\n\n* __Not like:__ As a busy provider, we feel your pain. By now you should have gotten the point that co-sourcing requires we have a good relationship with each other. :)\n\nFor more information, refer to our [Client Communications Voice and Tone Guidelines](http://share.athenahealth.com/tweety/UX/Copy/Copy%20Resources/client%20voice%20+%20tone%20guide_final%20draft.pdf).\n\n<h2 id=\"consumers\">Writing for Consumers</h2>\n\n### Introduction\nWhen we write copy for athenahealth’s business (client-facing) products, we anticipate that the users reading it are health professional staff working in an office or clinical setting.\n\nWriting copy for our consumer products is a different situation. These users are patients and possibly their family and carers. We need to consider additional factors that can affect reading and understanding text, such as:\n\n* __Illness:__ Users may be coping with physical or mental illness (e.g., having the flu and booking an appointment to get it treated).\n* __Stress and emotions:__ Examples of stressful or emotional situations include waiting for test results, caring for sick loved ones, and handling medical bills.\n* __Setting:__ Consumers may be using these products in a variety of places (at home, on a library computer, on a mobile phone while holding a baby) and times (late at night, on a hurried lunch break, during a commute, on the way to the hospital).\n\nTherefore, when writing copy for consumer products, it is extremely important to write clearly and simply. We must also consider the users' situation and what information matters most at that time.\n\n### Writing Tips\n* Use short sentences and simple words.\n  * It’s better to use two short words that the user understands instead of one long word they do not.\n  * Try counting the syllables of your words. The ones with more syllables are good candidates for simplifying.\n* Write numbers as digits (1,2,3), not words (one, two, three).\n  * Do this even when the number begins the sentence. If it looks awkward, see if the sentence can be revised to begin with a different word.\n* Include accurate medical terms, but define or explain them when you use them for the first time.  \n  * Example: \"You will need to give a urine sample for a test to make sure your kidneys are healthy (microalbumin test).\"\n  * Even if a term seems long or complex, it's important to show the exact wording (along with an explanation). Users may need it for insurance questions or for internet searching.\n  * Use exact terms when requesting that a user perform a specific action. If you want a user to get a Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, you need to make sure you use that term and then define it.\n* Aim for a readability score of 8.0 (eighth grade) or lower.\n  * An ideal score is around 5.0 (fifth grade).\n  * Exclude medical terms when running the test.\n* Use [Microsoft Word’s built-in readability tool](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Test-your-document-s-readability-85b4969e-e80a-4777-8dd3-f7fc3c8b3fd2#____toc342546555) to check the reading level.\n* Avoid large blocks of text.\n  * Use short paragraphs, bullet lists, and whitespace to make text readable and scannable.\n\n### Voice and Tone\nWhen we create consumer-facing copy, we are either speaking as our clients' partner or speaking directly to our clients’ patients/consumers in the voice of that client. Content should always reinforce the client-patient relationship and enhance our clients' brands.\n\n__Do this:__\n\"Thank you for choosing us as your healthcare provider.

Pay your bill now.\"\n\n### Word List\n* __Immunization/vaccination/shot__\n  * When using the proper term, use immunization or vaccination.\n  * Otherwise, use the more casual \"shot\"\n* __Appointment/visit/check up__\n  * \"Visit\" is more appropriate for primary and routine care (e.g., sick visit, wellness visit).\n  * \"Appointment\" is more appropriate for specific services (e.g., mammogram appointment).\n  * \"Check up\" is a vague term and should only be used when we need to be intentionally vague.\n* __\"Book\" vs. \"schedule\" vs. \"make\" an appointment__\n  * \"Make an appointment\"\n    * More casual, appropriate for all types of appointments\n  * \"Schedule an appointment\"\n    * More formal, appropriate for all types of appointments\n  *  \"Book\"\n    * More promotional, appropriate for promotional emails\n* __Salutations__\n  * Adult populations\n    * Use first name only (never first and last name) due to privacy concerns (e.g., \"Hi [Patient First Name],\" or \"Hello [Patient First Name],\").\n    * Avoid using \"Hey\" and \"Dear\".\n  * Pediatric populations\n    * Use \"Hello [Patient Last Name] Family\" or simply \"Hello\" or \"Hi\".\n  * Guarantor populations\n    * Either skip the greeting or use \"Hello\".\n\n### Simpler Words\n\n<table class=\"fg_content-table\">\n<thead>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Instead of these:</th>\n\t\t<th>Try these:</th>\n\t</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Access (v)</td>\n\t\t<td>Get, be able to get</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Activate</td>\n\t\t<td>Start, turn on, begin</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Confirm</td>\n\t\t<td>Make sure, be sure</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Document (n)</td>\n\t\t<td>Paper, form, record</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Document (v)</td>\n\t\t<td>Take notes, keep a record</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Ensure</td>\n\t\t<td>Make sure, be sure</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Experience (n)</td>\n\t\t<td>How things went, what was it like</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Experiencing</td>\n\t\t<td>Feeling, having, happening</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Facilitate</td>\n\t\t<td>Help, make easier</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Increase</td>\n\t\t<td>Raise, go up</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Inform</td>\n\t\t<td>Tell, share, show</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Monitor</td>\n\t\t<td>Check, watch, keep an eye on</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Obtain</td>\n\t\t<td>Get</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Reduce</td>\n\t\t<td>Lower, go down</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Utilize</td>\n\t\t<td>Use</td>\n\t</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nMore health-related word alternatives can be found in the CDC’s [Everyday Words for Public Health Communication](https://www.cdc.gov/other/pdf/everydaywordsforpublichealthcommunication.pdf).\n\n### Resources and Further Reading\nBooks:\n* [Design for Real Life](https://abookapart.com/products/design-for-real-life) by Sara Wachter-Boettcher and Eric Meyer\n* [Health Literacy from A to Z](https://www.amazon.com/Health-Literacy-Practical-Communicate-Message/dp/1449600530/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433526184&sr=1-1) by Helen Osborne\n\nWebsites:\n* [Health Literacy (National Network of Libraries of Medicine)](https://nnlm.gov/initiatives/topics/health-literacy)\n* [Health Literacy (MedlinePlus)](https://medlineplus.gov/healthliteracy.html)\n\nBlogs and podcasts:\n* [We <3 Health Literacy](https://medium.com/wehearthealthliteracy)\n* [Health Literacy Out Loud](http://www.healthliteracyoutloud.com/)\n\n<h2 id=\"style\">Style - General</h2>\n\n### Acronyms and initialisms\n* Generally spelled out for first appearance in body copy, followed by the acronym/initialism in parentheses. No periods.\n* Example: \"One product is an electronic health record (EHR).\"\n\n### Buttons\n* Button names:\n  * Title case capitalization. For example, \"Submit Form\", \"Download Report.\"\n  * Concise. If button copy is long, then it may be trying to explain too much about its function. Consider clarifying this somewhere else on the page.\n* Writing instructions about buttons:\n  * When referring to buttons, bold the button name (\"Enter your password and click __Log In__.\")\n  * Users \"click\" a button, not \"click on,\" \"press,\" or \"hit.\"\n    * __Exception:__ In touch screen interfaces, \"tap\" is appropriate instead of \"click.\"\n  * Unless confusion is likely, omit the word \"button.\"  (\"Click __Log In__\", not \"Click the __Log In__ button.\")\n\n### Branding and product names\n* Use athenahealth (company) and athenaNet (app), not \"athena.\"\n* Use athenaCommunicator, not \"Communicator\" (and similar for other product names).\n* \"Patient Portal\" (uppercase) vs. \"the portal\" (lowercase).\n* Lowercase company name/products are always lowercase, even when they begin a sentence.\n* Refer to marketing materials for proper branding/product names: [athenaHealth branding guidelines](https://athenabrand.guide/).\n\n### Clients, users, and customers\n* Use \"clients\" (not \"customers\") to refer to users in aggregate (e.g., \"athenaClinicals clients have access to this feature.\").\n* Use \"users\" to describe activity (e.g., \"Another user is editing this file.\").\n* Maintain a conversational voice by addressing the user when possible. Use \"you\" (clients) and \"we\" (athenahealth).\n\n### Continue vs. next\n* Use __continue__ when navigating through sequential steps in a workflow (e.g., moving through multiple steps for setting up an account).\n* Use __next__ when navigating through non-sequential screens or items (e.g., moving from one document or claim to another).  \n\n### Drop-down lists\n* Default selection for a drop-down list is \"- Select -\"\n* In help text, avoid using the term \"drop-down\". Use \"menu\" or \"list\" instead.\n* Example: Choose a doctor from the list below (not \"the drop-down list below\").\n\n### Errors and alerts\n\n#### Errors\nError messages can result from an unexpected system failure or an action taken by the user.\nForm validation errors generally result from the user entering information that's incomplete or inaccurate or that doesn’t match an expected format. Inline messaging is recommended for form validation errors. That way, attention is properly focused on the form fields that need editing (rather than somewhere else on the page).\n* Example: This discount code has expired.\n\nPlacement and styling of error messages can vary by product and context.\n\nIf inline error messages may be missed by the user (e.g., the form fields are below the fold), additional messaging can be used at the top of the page to indicate that one or more fields require attention.\n* Example (top of page): You must complete all required fields.\n* Example (inline): You have not entered a last name.\n\nError messages should give users the information needed to fix mistakes. Be clear and specific about why the user's input was not accepted.\n* __Do this:__ Email address should match the format \"person@domain.com\"\n* __Not this:__ Invalid email address\n\n#### Alerts\nAlerts are conditional messages that are displayed temporarily. They call attention to a change or encourage/require the user to take an action. Alerts should not be used to emphasize or stylize static page text.  \n\nThere are four categories of alerts:\n\n\n* __1 - Information (purple/blue)__\n  * Displays information that may be helpful or important to users but that doesn’t require action.\n  * Example: This patient's dosage for amoxicillin was adjusted on 11-20-16.\n\n* __2 - Confirmation/success (green)__\n  * Informs users that their action was completed successfully. Confirmation messages may not be necessary if the successful completion of the task is apparent (e.g., if users can see that an item was added or updated).\n  * Example: Provider information was successfully updated.\n\n* __3 - Attention (orange or yellow - varies by UI color palette)__\n  * Warns users that a problem has happened or that action is required.\n  * Example: Your practice must improve its performance on the Security Risk Assessment measure to stay on track for Meaningful Use. Take action\n\n* __4 - Critical (red)__\n  * Reserved for patient safety and other highly important issues (such as business issues that affect the financial health of the client).\n  * Example: Conflict with patient allergy: ASPIRIN\n\nFor color details, see the [Forge guide documentation on alert colors]({{ path '/docs/foundations/color' }}#alert).\n\n### Field labels\n* Sentence case capitalization (e.g., \"Last name\", \"Date of service\").\n* Nouns, not instruction (e.g., \"First name\", not \"Enter first name\").\n* No colon (:)\n  * __Exception:__ For read-only displays, colons may be used in certain circumstances depending on the design.\n* Do not use an input’s placeholder text instead of a label. This affects accessibility.\n  * Labels provide context. When users click into an input field, placeholder text disappears. This is not helpful for users with reading or memory issues who may need a persistent reminder of what the input field is for.\n  * Screen readers use labels to provide context.\n\n### Filtering, searching\n* A __filter__ is used to narrow information displayed on a page.\n  * Title is \"Filter by\"\n  * Button is \"Filter\"\n  * Link is \"Reset\"\n* A __lookup__ is used to search for information that is not displayed on a page by entering specific criteria.\n  * Title is \"[Item] Lookup\"\n  * Button is \"Find\"\n  * Link is \"Reset\"\n\n### Less vs. fewer\n* Use __less__ when describing something that is a single mass or concept (less water, less time, less stress).\n* Use __fewer__ when describing things that can be individually counted (fewer patients, fewer columns, fewer buttons).  \n\n### Links\n* Sentence case capitalization.\n  * __Exceptions:__\n    * In Streamlined patterns, standalone links are all-caps. Links that are part of, or follow, a sentence are sentence case.\n    * In Classic tables, action links are lowercase.\n* Avoid \"click here\" as link copy. Using the subject (or verb-subject) is more concise and properly focuses attention.\n  * __Do this:__ View the patient's demographic information.\n  * __Not this:__ Click here to view the patient's demographic information.\n\n### Lists\n* Bulleted (unordered) or numbered (ordered) lists:\n  * Use a numbered list if the order of the items is significant (e.g., step-by-step instructions).\n  * Otherwise, use a bulleted list.\n* Introduce bulleted lists with a colon (e.g., \"Important things to know:\").\n* Be concise. One feature/benefit/thought per bullet.\n* Use punctuation consistently.\n  * If the list items are complete sentences, use a period after each item.\n  * If the list items are phrases (e.g., Faster response time, Less work), do not use periods.\n* Use the same structure for list items (i.e., make them parallel). They should start with the same part of speech and use the same tense.\n  * __Do this:__ Activities of daily living include:\n    * Washing clothes\n    * Walking\n    * Driving a car\n    * Talking on the phone\n  * __Not this:__ Activities of daily living include:\n    * Washing clothes\n    * Walks\n    * To drive a car\n    * People talking on the phone\n\n### Plural vs. singular\n* Avoid using \"(s)\" to indicate that something can have either one response or multiple. Use a plural label if there's a chance of multiple answers.\n* Column headings should be singular if each cell in the column contains one piece of information, and plural if each cell could contain multiple pieces of information.\n  * Example: Use \"Denial Reason\" as the column heading if there’s only one reason per row; use \"Denial Reasons\" if there could be more than one.\n\n### View vs. show\nUse __view__ when the user's context will change (e.g., a modal or new page will open).\n* Example: View test results, View history\n\nUse __show__ when the user’s display on the current page will change (e.g., the user will see more instances of a listed item, additional details related to an item will be displayed, or a UI element will be added).\n\nIf \"show\" is appropriate, consider the context:\n* When more detail will be revealed about an item, use a show/hide toggle.\n  * Example: Show notes, Hide notes\n\n* When more instances of a listed item will be shown, use a \"more\" toggle.\n  * Example: Show more, Show fewer\n\n\n* When users need to know quantity, display the number that will be added.\n  * Example: Show more (10), Show fewer\n\n* When all instances of a listed item will be shown, use an \"all\" toggle.\n  * Example: Show all, Show fewer\n\n\n* When users need to know quantity, display the total number of items.\n  * Example: Show all (100), Show fewer\n\n* When it's not clear what is being shown, add detail.\n  * Example: Show more results, Show fewer results\n\n* When truncated text is displayed, use \"…Show more/Show less.\"  \n\n<h2 id=\"capitalization\">Capitalization</h2>\n\nathenaNet and the Patient Portal use a combination of sentence case and title case, depending on context.\n\n\n### Formats\n#### Sentence case\n* Capitalize the first word and proper nouns.\n* Examples: \"First and last name\", \"Other locations around Massachusetts\"\n\n#### Title case\n* Capitalize the first and last words and all other words except:\n  * Prepositions (e.g., around, near, of, on, with, without, about)\n  * Articles (e.g., a, an, the)\n  * Conjunctions (e.g., and, but)\n* Examples: \"Delete Patient Record\", \"Date of Service\"\n* Need help? Try this [title case converter](http://titlecase.com/).\n\n#### All caps\n* Avoid all caps, as it reduces readability and can be interpreted as shouting.\n\n#### Hyphenated words\n* When hyphenated words are part of a title, capitalize both words unless they are articles, prepositions, or coordinating conjunctions (and, but, for, or, nor).\n* Example: In-Depth\n\n#### Exceptions\n* Some products use a conversational, less formal tone in their copy (for example, products where patients are the intended audience). Even though an element may normally require title case, consider using sentence case instead if title case would make copy look awkward.\n  * __Do this:__ (button text) Yes, this is my doctor\n  * __Not this:__ Yes, This is My Doctor\n\n### Usage\n\n<table class=\"fg_content-table\">\n<thead>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Element</th>\n\t\t<th>Case</th>\n\t\t<th>Examples</th>\n\t</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Button</td>\n\t\t<td>\nTitle case</br></br>\n_Exception:_</br>\nSentence case is OK for conversational tone where title case would look awkward\n</td>\n<td>\nSave and Add Insurance</br></br>\n_Exception example:_</br>\nYes, book this appointment  \n</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Drop-down list item</td>\n\t\t<td>Sentence case</td>\n\t\t<td>Patient's father, Patient's mother</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Field label</td>\n\t\t<td>Sentence case</td>\n\t\t<td>Last name</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>File type, extension</td>\n\t\t<td>\nUppercase for file type</br>\nLowercase for file extension\n</td>\n\t\t<td>\nFile types: JPEG, GIF, DOC</br>\nExtensions: .gif, .pdf, .doc\n</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>\nHeadings:\n<ul>\n<li>Page heading</li>\n<li>Section heading</li>\n<li>Sub-section heading</li>\n<li>Heading for banner, alert, error message</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n\t\t<td>Title case</td>\n\t\t<td>Patient Registration, Guarantor Information</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Hint text, placeholder text</td>\n\t\t<td>Sentence case</td>\n\t\t<td>\n- Select a patient -</br>\n- Choose a diagnosis -\n</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Hover text, tooltip text</td>\n\t\t<td>Sentence case</td>\n\t\t<td>Indicates custom settings</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Icon label</td>\n\t\t<td>Title case</td>\n\t\t<td>Add Note, Lab Results</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Job title</td>\n\t\t<td>Lowercase</td>\n\t\t<td>doctor, nurse practitioner</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Link</td>\n\t\t<td>Sentence case</td>\n\t\t<td>Learn more, View a demo</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Tab labels</td>\n\t\t<td>Title case</td>\n\t\t<td>About Us, Provider Info</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Table</td>\n\t\t<td>\n      Title case\n      <ul>\n        <li>Title</li>\n        <li>Column heading</li>\n        <li>Row label</li>\n      </ul>\n      Sentence case\n      <ul>\n        <li>Cell value</li>\n      </ul>\n    </td>\n    <td></td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Tags</td>\n\t\t<td>Title case</td>\n\t\t<td>\n      In Process, Unfiled Claims<br><br>\n      _Note:_ Tag copy may be displayed in all caps/small caps using CSS, but the copy itself should not be in all caps.\n    </td>\n\t</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2 id=\"punctuation\">Punctuation</h2>\n\n### Ampersand (&)\n* When space is limited, an ampersand (&) can be used instead of the word \"and\" if the two terms are conceptually connected.\n* Example: Assessment & Plan\n\n### Commas\n* Use the serial comma (also called the Oxford comma). This means adding a comma __before__ the final \"and\" in a list.\n  * Example: Our employees are doctors, nurses, and medical assistants.\n* Add a comma between name and degree (Jane Doe, MD).\n* No comma between month and year (January 2010).\n* Use a comma after dates when referring to month, date, and year (January 4, 2010).\n* Use a comma after \"e.g.\" and \"i.e.\"\n  * Example: Use this form to order office supplies (e.g., paper, pens, staplers).\n\n### Ellipsis (…)\n* An ellipsis (plural, ellipses) is three periods in a row. It can be rendered as a single HTML character (`&#8230;` or `&hellip;`), which prevents the periods from being separated by line breaks.\n* In UI copy, an ellipsis can mean incompleteness, hidden/overflow content, or more of something inside. Uses include:\n  * Showing that text has been truncated (for example, displaying \"hyperli…\" instead of \"hyperlipidemia\" if the full text is too long for the allotted space)\n  * Conveying that a process is still running (such as in placeholder text like \"Getting patient records …\" or \"Loading claims data …\")\n\n<h2 id=\"formatting\">Formatting</h2>\n\n### Bolding, italics, and emphasis\n* Bold text for emphasis should be used sparingly. Bolding the right word or phrase can help to focus attention; bolding an entire sentence reduces readability and is less effective as emphasis. Avoid bolding entire paragraphs.\n* Bold text is used to refer to UI elements (such as buttons and links) when providing specific instructions. It is not used when writing about a term or UI element more conceptually.\n  * Writing specific instructions: \"Enter your password and click __Log In__.\"\n  * Writing more conceptually: \"Verify all information is correct in the Patient Demographic section.\"\n* Bold text should be the same color as the accompanying non-bold text.  Using a different color can be misinterpreted as a link.\n* Avoid using italics for emphasis when possible; they can reduce readability. Bolding is preferred.\n\n### Date and time\n* Date format: MM-DD-YYYY (or MM-DD-YY depending on space constraints and context)\n* When weekday abbreviations are necessary, use: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun (no period at the end)\n* Time format: 10:30 AM EST\n\n### Medications\n* Some athenahealth products use specific formats for medication names for safety and clarity reasons. Check with your PO whether these apply to your work. Formats include:\n  * [Tall Man lettering](https://www.ismp.org/recommendations/tall-man-letters-list) for visually distinguishing medications with similar names\n    * Example: acetaZOLAMIDE and acetoHEXAMIDE\n\n### Numbers\n* In body copy, use numerals for 10 and above, spell out zero through nine unless the number precedes a unit of measure (3 quarts, three cars).\n* Use this system with flexibility:\n  * Avoid statements such as \"Nine of the 12 patients arrived for their appointments.\"\n* When a number in the UI is variable, always use a numeral.\n  * Example: 5 items selected\n* Include a space between numbers and units (e.g., 300 KB).\n* Safety issues: Some athenahealth products use special number formats as a safety precaution. Check with your PO whether this applies to your work. For example, these styles may be used for medication doses:\n  * Including leading zeroes: \"0.5\" rather than \".5\"\n  * Leaving out trailing zeroes: \"10\" rather than \"10.0\"\n\n### Phone numbers\n* Phone number format: (###) ###-####\n\n<h2 id=\"wordlist\">Word List</h2>\n\n\n### Product-specific words\nSome words have specific meanings in athenahealth products (or in healthcare in general). Check the [O-help Glossary](http://share.athenahealth.com/tweety/Knowledge%20Management/XInternalTarget/Content/Features/Glossary_A.htm) to check if you're using a term correctly.\n\nBefore you name a new feature or option, confirm that the term isn’t already used somewhere else in athenaNet.
